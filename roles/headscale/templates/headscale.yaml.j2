# Note: Remote access _only_ works if you have
# valid certificates.
#
# For production:

# DERP is a relay system that Tailscale uses when a direct

# headscale needs a list of DERP servers that can be presented
# to the clients.
derp:
  server:
    # If enabled, runs the embedded DERP server and merges it into the rest of the DERP config
    # The Headscale server_url defined above MUST be using https, DERP requires TLS to be in place
    enabled: false

# Time before an inactive ephemeral node is deleted?
ephemeral_node_inactivity_timeout: 30m

# Period to check for node updates within the tailnet. A value too low will severely affect
# CPU consumption of Headscale. A value too high (over 60s) will cause problems

### TLS configuration
#
## Let's encrypt / ACME
#
# headscale supports automatically requesting and setting up
# TLS for a domain with Let's Encrypt.
#
# URL to ACME directory
acme_url: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# Email to register with ACME provider
acme_email: ""

# Domain name to request a TLS certificate for:
tls_letsencrypt_hostname: ""

# Path to store certificates and metadata needed by
# letsencrypt
# For production:
tls_letsencrypt_cache_dir: /var/lib/headscale/cache

# Type of ACME challenge to use, currently supported types:
# HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01
# See [docs/tls.md](docs/tls.md) for more information
tls_letsencrypt_challenge_type: HTTP-01
# When HTTP-01 challenge is chosen, letsencrypt must set up a
# verification endpoint, and it will be listening on:
# :http = port 80
tls_letsencrypt_listen: ":http"

## Use already defined certificates:
tls_cert_path: ""
tls_key_path: ""

log:
  # Output formatting for logs: text or json
  format: text
  level: info

# Path to a file containg ACL policies.
# ACLs can be defined as YAML or HUJSON.
# https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/

# headscale supports Tailscale's DNS configuration and MagicDNS.

  # With metadata sharing:

  #   # you can also put it in one line

  magic_dns: true

  # Defines the base domain to create the hostnames for MagicDNS.

# Unix socket used for the CLI to connect without authentication
# Note: for production you will want to set this to something like:

# Logtail configuration
# Logtail is Tailscales logging and auditing infrastructure, it allows the control panel
# to instruct tailscale nodes to log their activity to a remote server.
logtail:
  # Enable logtail for this headscales clients.
  # As there is currently no support for overriding the log server in headscale, this is
  # disabled by default. Enabling this will make your clients send logs to Tailscale Inc.
  enabled: false

# Enabling this option makes devices prefer a random port for WireGuard traffic over the
# default static port 41641. This option is intended as a workaround for some buggy
# firewall devices. See https://tailscale.com/kb/1181/firewalls/ for more information.
